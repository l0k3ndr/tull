# tull - Teleport Ur Logs with Love


This is something I found useful while working from remote. It helps you share your logs more easily and simple manner without having to copy paste them on emails etc. 

Installion with pip. `pip install tull`

Execute `tull web` and it will give you few urls. Open the one with TULL_WEB_URL in front.

For each session `tull` generates a ID, and that ID is used to associate the data of that session.

Type anything into the active terminal. On the web also on the correponding ID page it will reflect.

Exit with Ctrl-D.
